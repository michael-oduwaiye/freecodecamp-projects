# Photo Gallery
This is a responsive photo gallery webpage I built as part of the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** curriculum using Flexbox so that it looks good on any screen size.
Flexbox is short for the "Flexible Box Layout module. It is a layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. It  makes it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure, without using float or positioning. It is a one dimensional CSS layout (design) that control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container.
It showcases how to use **flexbox techniques** to display and organize images in a clean and user-friendly way.
